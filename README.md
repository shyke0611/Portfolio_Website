<!-- REFLECTION -->
## Reflection

#### Context and Motivation

Having gained some practice through my high fidelity prototype project, I was motivated to apply these skills to create my personal portfolio website. My primary goal was to develop a clean and simple website that would allow users to quickly and easily access the information they needed. This project was driven by my desire to present my work and achievements in a straightforward and professional manner.

#### Project Goals

The main goal of this project was to build a personal portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I aimed to design a site that was both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional, ensuring that the user experience was intuitive and seamless. By keeping the design minimalistic, I wanted to ensure that visitors could focus on the content without being distracted by overly complex elements.

### Challenges and Learning Experience

One of the significant challenges I encountered was getting the animations right. Although I had a vision for smooth and engaging transitions, implementing them proved to be more difficult than anticipated. This struggle led me to seek help from various online resources and communities. Through this process, I learnt the importance of detailed planning and the value of external guidance. The experience not only improved my technical skills but also highlighted the importance of perseverance and resourcefulness in problem-solving.
